[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/rrr2gbi0pw2dkynv?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jonathan-rizk/owtp)

## STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Ordinary Water Thermodynamic Properties (OWTP) is an open-source C library that calculates the thermodynamic properties of ordinary water, which is based on release R7-97 from the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS R7-97).

## Project Goals

1. Provide a thoroughly-tested, lightweight library that provides conventional steam tables functionality.
2. Encourage the proliferation of applications that would require the use of conventional steam tables.
3. Provide relatively easy interop with other languages.

## Documentation

Documents will be created once the core functionality has been completed.
