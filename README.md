# Ordinary Water Thermodynamic Properties

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/rrr2gbi0pw2dkynv?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jonathan-rizk/owtp)

## STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

OWTP is an open-source C library that calculates the thermodynamic properties of ordinary water, which is based on release R7-97 from the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS R7-97).

## Intentions

OWTP is intended to be a small, fast, and thoroughly-tested steam tables library. The SI unit system that is used in the IAPWS R7-97 is the unit system that will be exported.
