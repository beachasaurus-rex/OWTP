[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/rrr2gbi0pw2dkynv?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jonathan-rizk/owtp)

## STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Ordinary Water Thermodynamic Properties (OWTP) is an open-source C library that calculates the thermodynamic properties of ordinary water, which is based on release R7-97 from the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS R7-97).

## Project Goals

1. Provide a thoroughly-tested library that can be used as a reference for those familiar with conventional steam tables.
2. Encourage the proliferation of applications that would require the use of conventional steam tables.
3. Provide compiled functions that can easily interop with most other languages.
4. Provide a lightweight library only focused around providing the functionality of conventional steam tables.

## Documentation

Documents will be created once the core functionality has been completed.
